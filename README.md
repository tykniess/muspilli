Introducing Muspilli, a Finite-State Transducer for the Old Saxon language.
Built on the framework of Helsinki Finite-State Technologies (HFST) using
KÃ¶bler's Old Saxon Dictionary.

In order to work with the transducer, you need to have installed HFST <hfst.github.io>. I will post output forms in .txt files for easy searching for non-programmers.

If you notice an error, please send me a message on github so I can correct it.

Enjoy!
